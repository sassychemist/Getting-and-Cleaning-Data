## Codebook


This codebook describes the fields and details found in the file `combinedData.txt` generated by `run_analysis.R`.

### Identifiers
- `subject` is the Subject's identifying number
- `activity` is the activity that the subject was undertaking during the corresponding measurement


### Measurement Variables

#### Additional notes on the variables (adapted from Jorge L. Reyes-Ortiz, Davide Anguita, Alessandro Ghio, Luca Oneto. Smartlab - Non Linear Complex Systems Laboratory)
The features selected for this dataset come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. The acceleration signal was separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc and tGravityAcc). Here the dataset is reduced to include the mean and standard deviation of these measurements.

The body linear acceleration and angular velocity were included to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk and tBodyGyroJerk). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals are included (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). Here we have reduced the dataset to include the mean and standard deviation of these measurements.

The signals producing fBodyAcc, fBodyAccJerk, fBodyGyro, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag are included as the means and standard deviation of the measurements. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

### Activity Labels

Each label describes and activity that the subject was undertaking during the training or the test.

- WALKING (code 1): the subject was walking
- WALKING_UPSTAIRS (code 2): the subject was walking up a staircase
- WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS (code 3): the subject was walking down as staircase
- SITTING (code 4): the subject was sitting
- STANDING (code 5): the subject was standing
- LAYING (code 6): the subject was in a reclined position
